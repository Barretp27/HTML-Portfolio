<h1>The Best Movies According to Barret</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Independence Day</h3>
<p>
  This 1996 film is action packed with good dialogue and sci-fi elements. Will
  Smith and Jeff Goldblum star together in this one.
</p>
<h3>The Witcher (series)</h3>
<p>
  Really cool sci-fi TV show with one of my favorite actors, Henry Cavil. This
  3+ series contents awesome visuals, realistic fight choreography, and elements
  of magic!
</p>
<h3>Green Snake</h3>
<p>Super beautifully animated film. Really artistic.</p>
