    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Barret Paivalainen and I was born in Canada in the city of
      Thunderbay in the province of Ontario. Although I was born in Thunderbay,
      I actually grew up in the capital city of Canada's Northwest Territories,
      Yellowknife. Here I graduated high school and lived from about the age of
      11 to my current age of 31. Yellowknife will always be a home base for me.
      Yellowknife is truely a beautiful place, with great lakes, the aurora, a
      great community with diversity, and awesome outdoors.<br /><br />
      I also have attended 5 years of post-secondary education taking various
      science-based courses and attained a diploma in electrical engineering
      technology at the beginning of 2016 and I have various experience working
      in physically demanding work environments. Although I have much experience
      with physically and mentally demanding work, my real interests are in the
      health, fitness, longevity, spiritual, and now finacial realm. I first
      started my journey in health when i was around 17 or so. It started with
      physical fitness by going to the gym with a friend. Then, like most people
      that start working out, nutrition should naturally follow the interest in
      physical fitness. This is when I really started researching and educating
      myself in diet and nutrition. I started watching a lot of youtube,
      documentaries, and most importantly reseacrhing and reading peer reviewed
      research papers (on anything to do with foods and bodily systems).
      <br /><br />
      Next, i started getting into the spiritual or energetic side of things.
      Mostly with meditation, yoga, breathwork and quantum physics. Although
      this sounds mystical in nature, it really isn't and mostly can be
      supported and explained with science. And not even complicated or
      sophisticated sciences.
